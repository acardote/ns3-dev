/**
 * \brief Maintain the event list
 *
 * This base class specifies the interface used to maintain the 
 * event list. If you want to provide a new event list scheduler, 
 * you need to create a subclass of this base class and implement 
 * all the pure virtual methods defined here. Namely:
 *   - ns3::Scheduler::Insert
 *   - ns3::Scheduler::IsEmpty
 *   - ns3::Scheduler::PeekNext
 *   - ns3::Scheduler::RemoveNext
 *   - ns3::Scheduler::Remove
 *
 * If you need to provide a new event list scheduler without
 * editing the main simulator class, you need to also implement
 * a subclass of the ns3::SchedulerFactory base class and
 * feed it to ns3::Simulator::setExternal.
 * The simplest example of a scheduler is the linked-list
 * scheduler included in ns3: see the files 
 * src/simulator/scheduler-list.h and src/simulator/scheduler-list.cc
