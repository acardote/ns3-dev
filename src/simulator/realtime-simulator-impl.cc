      // after the closing brace above.
      //
      // It's easiest to understand if you just consider a short tsDelay that only
      // requires a SpinWait down in the synchronizer.  What will happen is that 
      // whan Synchronize calls SpinWait, SpinWait will look directly at its 
      // condition variable.  Note that we set this condition variable to false 
      // inside the critical section above. 
      //
      // SpinWait will go into a forever loop until either the time has expired or
      // until the condition variable becomes true.  A true condition indicates that
      // the wait should stop.  The condition is set to true by one of the Schedule
      // methods of the simulator; so if we are in a wait down in Synchronize, and
      // a Simulator::Schedule is done, the wait down in Synchronize will exit and
      // Synchronize will return (false).
      //
      // So, we set this condition to false in a critical section.  The code that
      // sets the condition (Simulator::Schedule) also runs protected by the same
      // critical section mutex -- there is no race.  We call Synchronize -- if no
      // Simulator::Schedule is done, the waits (sleep- and spin-wait) will complete
      // and Synchronize will return true.  If a Schedule is done before we get to 
      // Synchronize, the Synchronize code will check the condition before going to
      // sleep.  If a Schedule happens while we are sleeping, we let the kernel wake
      // us up.
      //
      // So the bottom line is that we just stay in this for loop, looking for the
      // next timestamp and attempting to sleep until its due.  If we've slept until
      // the timestamp is due, Synchronize() returns true and we break out of the 
      //sync loop.  If we're interrupted we continue in the loop.  We may find that
      // the next timestamp is actually earlier than we thought, but we continue 
      // around the loop and reevaluate and wait for that one correctly.

  // Okay, now more words.  We have slept without interruption until the 
  // timestamp we found at the head of the event list when we started the sleep.
  // We are now outside a critical section, so another schedule operation can
  // sneak in.  What does this mean?  The only thing that can "go wrong" is if
  // the new event was moved in ahead of the timestamp for which we waited.
  //
  // If you think about it, this is not a problem, since the best we can 
  // possibly do is to execute the event as soon as we can execute it.  We'll
  // be a little late, but we were late anyway.
  //
  // So we just go ahead and pull the first event off of the list, even though
  // it may be the case that it's not actually the one we waited for.
  //
  // One final tidbit is, "what the heck time is it anyway"?  The simulator is
  // going to want to get a timestamp from the next event and wait until the
  // wall clock time is equal to the timestamp.  At the point when those times
  // are the same (roughly) we get to this point and set the m_currentTs below.
  // That's straightforward here, but you might ask, how does the next event get
  // the time when it is inserted from an external source?

  // The method RealtimeSimulatorImpl::ScheduleNow takes makes an event and 
  // needs to schedule that event for immediate execution.  If the simulator is 
  // not locked to a realtime source, the current time is m_currentTs.  If it is

  // scheduler thread (eg. it is in the context of a separate device thread).  
  // It would be bad (TM) if we naively wrapped the EventImpl up in an EventId 
  // that would be accessible from multiple threads without considering thread 
  // safety.
  //
  // Having multiple EventId containing Ptr<EventImpl> in different thread
  // contexts creates a situation where atomic reference count decrements
  // would be required (think about an event being scheduled with the calling
  // yielding immediately afterward.  The scheduler could become ready and 
  // fire the event which would eventually want to release the EventImpl.  If
  // the calling thread were readied and executed in mid-release, it would also
  // want to release the EventImpl "at the same time."  If we are careless about
  // this, multiple deletes are sure to eventually happen as the threads 
  // separately play with the EventImpl reference counts.
  // 
  // The way this all works is that we created an EventImpl in the template 
  // function that called us, which may be in the context of a thread separate
  // from the simulator thread.  We are managing the lifetime of the EventImpl
  // with an intrusive reference count.  The count was initialized to one when
  // it was created and is still one right now.  We're going to "wrap" this
  // EventImpl in an EventId in this method.  There's an assignment of our 
  // Ptr<EventImpl> into another Ptr<EventImpl> inside the EventId which will 
  // bump the ref count to two.  We're going to return this EventId to the 
  // caller so the calling thread will hold a reference to the underlying 
  // EventImpl.  This is what causes the first half of the multithreading issue.
  //
  // We are going to call Insert() on the EventId to put the event into the 
  // scheduler.  Down there, it will do a PeekEventImpl to get the pointer to
  // the EventImpl and manually increment the reference count (to three).  From 
  // there, the sheduler works with the EventImpl pointer.  When the EventId 
  // below goes out of scope, the Ptr<EventImpl> destructor is run and the ref
  // count is decremented to two.  When this function returns to the calling
  // template function, the Ptr<EventImpl> there will go out of scope and we'll
  // decrement the EventImpl ref count leaving it to be the one held by our
  // scheduler directly.
  //
  // The scheduler removes the EventImpl in Remove() or RemoveNext().  In the
  // case of Remove(), the scheduler is provided an Event reference and locates
  // the corresponding EventImpl in the event list.  It gets the raw pointer to
  // the EventImpl, erases the pointer in the list, and manually calls Unref()
  // on the pointer.  In RemoveNext(), it gets the raw pointer from the list and
  // assigns it to a Ptr<EventImpl> without bumping the reference count, thereby
  // transferring ownership to a containing EventId.  This is the second half of
  // the multithreading issue.
  //
  // It's clear that we cannot have a situation where the EventImpl is "owned" by
  // multiple threads.  The calling thread is free to hold the EventId as long as
  // it wants and manage the reference counts to the underlying EventImpl all it
  // wants.  The scheduler is free to do the same; and will eventually release
  // the reference in the context of thread running ProcessOneEvent().  It is 
  // "a bad thing" (TM) if these two threads decide to release the underlying
  // EventImpl "at the same time."
  //
  // The answer is to make the reference counting of the EventImpl thread safe; 
  // which we do.  We don't want to force the event implementation to carry around
  // a mutex, so we "lend" it one using a RealtimeEventLock object (m_eventLock)
  // in the constructor and take it back in the destructor.
