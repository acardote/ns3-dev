 * Normally the functions in the ns3::olsr namespace are more simple
 * to use to start OLSR on nodes, but access to the underlying OLSR
 * agent can be useful in order to customize the OLSR parameters.
 * Example:
 *
 * \code
 * Ptr<olsr::Agent> olsr = ComponentManager::Create<olsr::Agent, Ptr<Node> > (olsr::Agent::cid, olsr::Agent::iid, node);
 * agent->SetMainInterface (2);

   * OLSR routing messages must have the main interface address,

   * This method allows one to explicitly select an interface as the

   * calling it is optional; if not called, the agent tries to guess
   * and uses a suitable interface.
