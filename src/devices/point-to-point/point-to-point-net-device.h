 * \class PointToPointNetDevice
 * \brief A Device for a Point to Point Network Link.
 *
 * Ns-3 takes a four-layer view of a protocol stack.  This is the same model
 * that TCP uses.  In this view, layers 5-7 of the OSI reference model are
 * grouped together into an application layer; layer four (transport / TCP) is
 * broken out; layer three (network / IP) is broken out; and layers 1-2 are
 * grouped together.  We call this grouping of layers one and two a NetDevice
 * and represent it as a class in the system.
 *
 * The NetDevice class is specialized according to the needs of the specific
 * kind of network link.  In this case, the link is a PointToPoint link.  The
 * PointToPoint link is a family of classes that includes this class, the
 * PointToPointNetDevice, a PointToPointChannel class that represents the 
 * actual medium across which bits are sent, a PointToPointIpv4Interface class
 * that provides the hook to tie a general purpose node to this specific
 * link, and finally, a PointToPointTopology object that is responsible for
 * putting all of the pieces together.
 *
 * This is the PointToPointNetDevice class that represents, essentially, the
 * PC card that is used to connect to the PointToPoint network.
