/**
 * \brief Simple Point To Point Channel.
 *
 * This class represents a very simple serial channel.  Think full duplex
 * RS-232 or RS-422 with null modem and no handshaking.  There is no multi-
 * drop capability on this channel -- there can be a maximum of two serial 
 * net devices connected.  Once we start talking about multi-drop, or CSMA, 
 * or some other sharing mechanism, things begin getting complicated quickly.
 * Rather than invent some ad-hoc mechanism, we just Keep It Simple everywhere.
 *
 * When the channel is instaniated, the constructor takes parameters for
 * a single channel speed, in bits per second, and a delay time as a Time
 * object.  Both directions use the same speed and delay time.
 *
 * There are two "wires" in the channel.  The first device connected gets the
 * [0] wire to transmit on.  The second device gets the [1] wire.  There is a
 * state (IDLE, TRANSMITTING) associated with each wire.
