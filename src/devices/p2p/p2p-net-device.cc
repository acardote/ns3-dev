// This class simulates a point to point device.  In the case of a serial
// link, this means that we're simulating something like a UART.  This is
// not a requirement for a point-to-point link, but it's a typical model for
// the device.  
//
// Generally, a real device will have a list of pending packets to transmit.  
// An on-device CPU frees the main CPU(s) of the details of what is happening
// in the device and feeds the USART.  The main CPU basically just sees the 
// list of packets -- it puts packets into the list, and the device frees the
// packets when they are transmitted.
//
// In the case of our virtual device here, the queue pointed to by m_queue
// corresponds to this list.  The main CPU adds packets to the list by 
// calling this method and when the device completes a send, the packets are
// freed in an "interrupt" service routine.
//
// We're going to do the same thing here.  So first of all, the incoming packet
// goes onto our queue if possible.  If the queue can't handle it, there's
// nothing to be done.
//

//
// If there's a transmission in progress, the "interrupt" will keep the
// transmission process going.  If the device is idle, we need to start a
// transmission.
//
// In the real world, the USART runs until it finishes sending bits, and then
// pulls on the device's transmit complete interrupt wire.  At the same time,
// the electrons from the last wiggle of the wire are busy propagating down
// the wire.  In the case of a long speed-of-light delay in the wire, we could
// conceivably start transmitting the next packet before the end of the 
// previously sent data has even reached the end of the wire.  This situation
// is usually avoided (like the plague) and an "interframe gap" is introduced.
// This is usually the round-trip delay on the channel plus some hard-to-
// quantify receiver turn-around time (the time required for the receiver
// to process the last frame and prepare for reception of the next).
//
// So, if the transmit machine is ready, we need to schedule a transmit 
// complete event (at which time we tell the channel we're no longer sending
// bits).  A separate transmit ready event (at which time the transmitter 
// becomes ready to start sending bits again is scheduled there).  Finally, 
// we tell the channel (via TransmitStart ()) that we've started wiggling the 
// wire and bits are coming out.
//
// If the transmit machine is not ready, we just leave and the transmit ready
// event we know is coming will kick-start the transmit process.
