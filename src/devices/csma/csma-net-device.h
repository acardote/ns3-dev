 * \class CsmaNetDevice
 * \brief A Device for a Csma Network Link.
 *
 * The Csma net device class is analogous to layer 1 and 2 of the
 * TCP stack. The NetDevice takes a raw packet of bytes and creates a
 * protocol specific packet from them. 
 *
 * The Csma net device class takes a packet and adds (or removes) the 
 * headers/trailers that are associated with EthernetV1, EthernetV2, RAW
 * or LLC protocols. The EthernetV1 packet type adds and removes Ethernet
 * destination and source addresses. The LLC packet type adds and
 * removes LLC snap headers. The raw packet type does not add or
 * remove any headers.  
 *
 * Each Csma net device will receive all packets written to the Csma link. 
 * The ProcessHeader function can be used to filter out the packets such that
 * higher level layers only receive packets that are addressed to their
 * associated net devices
