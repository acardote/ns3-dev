/**

 * 
 * \brief A bridge to make it appear that a host is connected to an ns-3 net device.
 *
 * The Tap Bridge lives in a kind of a gray world somewhere between a Linux host and
 * an ns-3 bridge device.  From the Linux perspective, this code appears as the user
 * mode handler for a Tap net device.  That is, when the Linux host writes to the
 * /dev/tap device that we create for it, the write is redirected into the TapBridge
 * and from that perspective, becomes a read.  The TapBridge then redirects the data
 * written (by the Linux host) to the tap device on out the ns-3 net device to which
 * we are bridged.  When a packet comes in from the ns-3 world to the ns-3 net device
 * we are bridging, it appears via a callback from that net device.  Our job is to
 * take those bits and write them back to the host using the user mode handler for
 * /dev/tapx.  This write to the device will then appear to the Linux host as if a 
 * packet has arrived on its device.
 *
 * The upshot is that the Tap Bridge appears to bridge a tap device on a Linux host 
 * in the "real world" to an ns-3 net device in the simulation.  In order to do this
 * we need a "ghost node" in the simulation to hold the bridged ns-3 net device and 
 * this Tap Bridge.  It won't actually do anything else in the simulation.  You will
 * be able to perform typical ns-3 operations on that node, but they will have no
 * effect other than to set up, tear down and configure the net devices and bridges
 * mentioned above.
