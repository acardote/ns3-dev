 * \brief A helper class to create CsmaCd Topologies 
 *
 * CsmaCd topologies are created based on the
 * ns3::CsmaCdNetDevice subclasses and ns3::CsmaCdChannel
 * objects.  This class uses the EthernetNetDevice and
 * PacketSocket classes in order to create logical connections between
 * net devices. The PacketSocket class generates the data and the
 * EthernetNetDevice class creates ethernet packets from the
 * data, filling in source and destination addresses. The
 * EthernetNetDevice class filters received data packets
 * according to its destination Mac addresses.
