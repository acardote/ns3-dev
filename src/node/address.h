/**
 * \brief a polymophic address class
 *
 * This class is very similar in design and spirit to the BSD sockaddr
 * structure: they are both used to hold multiple types of addresses
 * together with the type of the address.
 *
 * A new address class defined by a user needs to:
 *   - allocate a type id with Address::Register
 *   - provide a method to convert his new address to an Address 
 *     instance. This method is typically a member method named ConvertTo:
 *     Address MyAddress::ConvertTo (void) const;
 *   - provide a method to convert an Address instance back to
 *     an instance of his new address type. This method is typically
 *     a static member method of his address class named ConvertFrom:
 *     static MyAddress MyAddress::ConvertFrom (const Address &address);
 *   - the ConvertFrom method is expected to check that the type of the
 *     input Address instance is compatible with its own type.
 *
 * Typical code to create a new class type looks like:
 * \code
 * // this class represents addresses which are 2 bytes long.
 * class MyAddress
 * {
 * public:
 *   Address ConvertTo (void) const;
 *   static MyAddress ConvertFrom (void);
 * private:
 *   static uint8_t GetType (void);
 * };
 *
 * Address MyAddress::ConvertTo (void) const
 * {
 *   return Address (GetType (), m_buffer, 2);
 * }
 * MyAddress MyAddress::ConvertFrom (const Address &address)
 * {
 *   MyAddress ad;
 *   NS_ASSERT (address.CheckCompatible (GetType (), 2));
 *   address.CopyTo (ad.m_buffer, 2);
 *   return ad;
 * }
 * uint8_t MyAddress::GetType (void)
 * {
 *   static uint8_t type = Address::Register ();
 *   return type;
 * }
 * \endcode
