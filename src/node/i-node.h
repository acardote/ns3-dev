 * \brief A network Node.

 * This class holds together:
 *   - a list of NetDevice objects which represent the network interfaces
 *     of this node which are connected to other Node instances through
 *     Channel instances.
 *   - a list of Application objects which represent the userspace
 *     traffic generation applications which interact with the Node
 *     through the Socket API.
 *   - a node Id: a unique per-node identifier.
 *   - a system Id: a unique Id used for parallel simulations.
 *   - a trace resolver which can be used to connect user trace sinks
 *     to the node's trace sources.
 *
 * Every Node created is added to the NodeList automatically.
