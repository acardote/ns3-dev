/**
 * \ingroup ipv4Routing
 * 
 * \brief Static routing protocol for IP version 4 stacks.
 *
 * In ns-3 we have the concept of a pluggable routing protocol.  Routing
 * protocols are added to a list maintained by the Ipv4L3Protocol.  Every 
 * stack gets one routing protocol for free -- the Ipv4StaticRouting routing
 * protocol is added in the constructor of the Ipv4L3Protocol (this is the 
 * piece of code that implements the functionality of the IP layer).
 *
 * The Ipv4StaticRouting class inherits from the abstract base class 
 * Ipv4RoutingProtocol that defines the interface methods that a routing 
 * protocol must support.
 *
 * When a packet arrives in the Ipv4L3Protocol for transmission, it comes
 * either from a local source via Ipv4L3Protocol::Send or from a remote 
 * source via Ipv4L3Protocol::Forwarding.  In both cases, a function is called
 * (Ipv4L3Protocol::Lookup) to look up the routing information for the packet.
 *
 * The lookup function iterates through the list of routing protocols asking
 * each to see if it can find a route and send the packet.  A callback is 
 * provided during each of these calls that should be considered a pre-
 * packaged send call.  This is done to allow asynchronous calls into 
 * routing subsystems in order to support on-demand routing, for example.  The
 * method for requesting this operation is Ipv4StaticRouting::RequestRoute for
 * the static routing protocol.
 *
 * Each routing protocol is also free to implement its own methods for managing
 * routes which you will find below.  This class manages a set of "static" or
 * manually configured routes for host, network and multicast routes.
 *

/**
 * \brief Add a multicast route to the static routing table.
 *
 * A multicast route must specify an origin IP address, a multicast group and

 * are sent.
 *
 * Typically there are two main types of multicast routes:  routes of the 
 * first kind are used during forwarding.  All of the conditions must be
 * exlicitly provided.  The second kind of routes are used to get packets off
 * of a local node.  The difference is in the input interface.  Routes for
 * forwarding will always have an explicit input interface specified.  Routes
 * off of a node will always set the input interface to a wildcard specified
 * by the index Ipv4RoutingProtocol::INTERFACE_ANY.
 *
 * For routes off of a local node wildcards may be used in the origin and
 * multicast group addresses.  The wildcard used for Ipv4Adresses is that 
 * address returned by Ipv4Address::GetAny () -- typically "0.0.0.0".  Usage
 * of a wildcard allows one to specify default behavior to varying degrees.
 *
 * For example, making the origin address a wildcard, but leaving the 
 * multicast group specific allows one (in the case of a node with multiple
 * interfaces) to create different routes using different output interfaces
 * for each multicast group.
 *
 * If the origin and multicast addresses are made wildcards, you have created
 * essentially a default multicast address that can forward to multiple 
 * interfaces.  Compare this to the actual default multicast address that is
 * limited to specifying a single output interface for compatibility with
 * existing functionality in other systems.
 * 
 * \param origin The Ipv4Address of the origin of packets for this route.  May
 * be Ipv4Address:GetAny for open groups.
 * \param group The Ipv4Address of the multicast group or this route.
 * \param inputInterface The input network interface index over which to 
 * expect packets destined for this route.  May be
 * Ipv4RoutingProtocol::INTERFACE_ANY for packets of local origin.

 * how to send packets to the destination(s).
