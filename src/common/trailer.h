/**
 * \brief Protocol trailer serialization and deserialization.
 *
 * Every Protocol trailer which needs to be inserted or removed
 * from a Packet instance must derive from this base class and
 * implement the following public methods:
 *   - a default constructor: is used by the internal implementation
 *     if the Packet class.
 *   - a static method named GetUid: is used to uniquely identify
 *     the type of each trailer. This method shall return a unique
 *     integer allocated with Trailer::AllocateUid.
 *   - a method named Print: is used by Packet::Print to print the 
 *     content of a trailer as ascii data to a c++ output stream.
 *     Although the trailer is free to format its output as it
 *     wishes, it is recommended to follow a few rules to integrate
 *     with the packet pretty printer: start with flags, small field 
 *     values located between a pair of parens. Values should be separated 
 *     by whitespace. Follow the parens with the important fields, 
 *     separated by whitespace.
 *     i.e.: (field1 val1 field2 val2 field3 val3) field4 val4 field5 val5
 *   - a method named GetName: is used by Packet::Print to print
 *     trailer fragments. This method should return a user-readable
 *     single word as all capitalized letters.
