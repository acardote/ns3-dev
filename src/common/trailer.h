/**
 * \brief Protocol trailer serialization and deserialization.
 *
 * Every Protocol trailer which needs to be inserted or removed
 * from a Packet instance must derive from this abstract base class
 * and implement the private pure virtual methods listed below:
 *   - ns3::Trailer::SerializeTo
 *   - ns3::Trailer::DeserializeFrom
 *   - ns3::Trailer::GetSerializedSize
 *   - ns3::Trailer::PrintTo
 *   - ns3::Trailer::DoGetName
 *
 * Each trailer must also make sure that:
 *   - it defines a public default constructor
 *   - it defines a public static method named GetUid which returns a string.
 *
 * The latter should look like the following to ensure that
 * every trailer returns a unique string.
 * \code
 * class MyTrailer : public Header
 * {
 * public:
 *   static const char *GetUid (void);
 * };
 *
 * const char *MyTrailer::GetUid (void)
 * {
 *   return "MyTrailer.unique.prefix";
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Note that the SerializeTo and DeserializeFrom methods behave
 * in a way which might seem surprising to users: the input iterator
 * really points to the end of the buffer to which and from which
 * the user is expected to write and read respectively. This means that
 * if the trailer has a fixed size and if the user wishes to read or
 * write that trailer from front to back, the user must rewind the 
 * iterator by hand to go to the start of the trailer. Typical code
 * looks like this:
 * \code
 * void CrcTrailer::SerializeTo (Buffer::Iterator end)
 * {
 *   end.Prev (4);
 *   end.WriteHtonU32 (m_crc);
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Some users would have expected that the iterator would be rewinded 
 * to the "start" of the trailer before calling SerializeTo and DeserializeFrom.
 * However, this behavior was not implemented because it cannot be made to
 * work reliably for trailers which have a variable size. i.e., if the trailer 
 * contains options, the code which calls DeserializeFrom cannot rewind
 * to the start of the trailer because it does not know the real size of the 
 * trailer. Hence, to make this legitimate use-case work (variable-sized 
 * trailers), the input iterator to DeserializeFrom and SerializeTo points
 * to the end of the trailer, and not its start.
