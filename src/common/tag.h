/**
 * \brief a tag can be stored in a packet.
 *
 * A tag is a blob of 16 bytes of data which can be stored in
 * a packet: a packet can contain an arbitrary number of tags
 * and these tags are considered as "on-the-side" per-packet
 * data structures which are not taken into account when calculating
 * the size of the payload of a packet. They exist solely as 
 * simulation-specific objects.
 *
 * Tags are typically used to:
 *   - implement per-packet cross-layer communication
 *   - implement packet coloring: you could store a "color" tag
 *     in a packet to mark various types of packet for
 *     simulation analysis
 *
 * To create a new type of tag, you must create a subclass
 * of the Tag base class which defines:
 *  - a public default constructor: needed for implementation
 *    purposes of the Packet code.
 *  - a public copy constructor: needed to copy a tag into
 *    a packet tag buffer when the user invokes Packet::AddTag
 *  - a public destructor: needed to destroy the copy of a tag
 *    stored in a packet buffer when the user invokes Packet::RemoveTag
 *    or when the packet is destroyed and the last reference to 
 *    a tag instance disapears.
 *  - a public static method named GetUid: needed to uniquely
 *    the type of each tag instance.
 *  - a public method named Print: needed to print the content
 *    of a tag when the user calls Packet::PrintTags
 *  - a public method named GetSerializedSize: needed to serialize
 *    the content of a tag to a byte buffer when a packet must
 *    be sent from one computing node to another in a parallel 
 *    simulation. If this method returns 0, it means that the
 *    tag does not need to be transfered from computing node to 
 *     computing node
 *  - a public method named Serialize: perform the serialization
 *    to a byte buffer upon transfer to a new computing node in a 
 *    parallel simulation.
 *  - a public method named Deserialize: invert the serialization
 *    from a byte buffer after being transfered to a new computing
 *    node in a parallel simulation.
 *
 * A detailed example of what these methods should look like
 * and how they should be implemented is described in samples/main-packet-tag.cc
