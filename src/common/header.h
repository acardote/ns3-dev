/**
 * \brief Protocol header serialization and deserialization.
 *
 * Every Protocol header which needs to be inserted or removed
 * from a Packet instance must derive from this abstract base class
 * and implement the private pure virtual methods listed below:
 *   - ns3::Header::SerializeTo
 *   - ns3::Header::DeserializeFrom
 *   - ns3::Header::GetSerializedSize
 *   - ns3::Header::PrintTo
 *   - ns3::Header::DoGetName
 *
 * Each header must also make sure that:
 *   - it defines a public default constructor
 *   - it defines a public static method named GetUid which returns a 32 bit integer
 *
 * The latter should look like the following:
 * \code
 * // in the header,
 * class MyHeader : public Header
 * {
 * public:
 *   static uint32_t GetUid (void);
 * };
 *
 * // in the source file:
 * NS_HEADER_ENSURE_REGISTERED (MyHeader);
 *
 * uint32_t MyHeader::GetUid (void)
 * {
 *   static uint32_t uid = Header::Register<MyHeader> ("MyHeader.unique.prefix");
 *   return uid;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Sample code which shows how to create a new Header, and how to use it, 
 * is shown in the sample file samples/main-header.cc
