 *
 * \section internetStackTracingModel Tracing in the Internet Stack
 *
 * The internet stack provides a number of trace sources in its various
 * protocol implementations.  These trace sources can be hooked using your own 
 * custom trace code, or you can use our helper functions in some cases to 
 * arrange for tracing to be enabled.
 *
 * \subsection internetStackArpTracingModel Tracing in ARP
 *
 * ARP provides two trace hooks, one in the cache, and one in the layer three
 * protocol.  The trace accessor in the cache is given the name "Drop."  When
 * a packet is transmitted over an interface that requires ARP, it is first
 * queued for transmission in the ARP cache until the required MAC address is
 * resolved.  There are a number of retries that may be done trying to get the 
 * address, and if the maximum retry count is exceeded the packet in question 
 * is dropped by ARP.  The single trace hook in the ARP cache is called,
 *
 * - If an outbound packet is placed in the ARP cache pending address resolution
 *   and no resolution can be made within the maximum retry count, the outbound 
 *   packet is dropped and this trace is fired;
 *
 * A second trace hook lives in the ARP L3 protocol (also named "Drop") and may 
 * be called for a  number of reasons.
 *
 * - If an ARP reply is received for an entry that is not waiting for a reply,
 *   the ARP reply packet is dropped and this trace is fired;
 * - If an ARP reply is received for a non-existant entry, the ARP reply packet 
 *   is dropped and this trace is fired;
 * - If an ARP cache entry is in the DEAD state (has timed out) and an ARP reply
 *   packet is received, the reply packet is dropped and this trace is fired.
 * - Each ARP cache entry has a queue of pending packets.  If the size of the
 *   queue is exceeded, the outbound packet is dropped and this trace is fired.
 *
 * \subsection internetStackIpv4TracingModel Tracing in IPv4
 *
 * The IPv4 layer three protocol provides three trace hooks.  These are the 
 * "Tx" (ns3::Ipv4L3Protocol::m_txTrace), "Rx" (ns3::Ipv4L3Protocol::m_rxTrace) 
 * and "Drop" (ns3::Ipv4L3Protocol::m_dropTrace) trace sources.
 *
 * The "Tx" trace is fired in a number of situations, all of which indicate that
 * a given packet is about to be sent down to a given ns3::Ipv4Interface.
 *
 * - In the case of a packet destined for the broadcast address, the 
 *   Ipv4InterfaceList is iterated and for every interface that is up and can
 *   fragment the packet or has a large enough MTU to transmit the packet,
 *   the trace is hit.  See ns3::Ipv4L3Protocol::Send.
 *
 * - In the case of a packet that needs routing, the "Tx" trace may be fired
 *   just before a packet is sent to the interface appropriate to the default 
 *   gateway.  See ns3::Ipv4L3Protocol::SendRealOut.
 *
 * - Also in the case of a packet that needs routing, the "Tx" trace may be 
 *   fired just before a packet is sent to the outgoing interface appropriate
 *   to the discovered route.  See ns3::Ipv4L3Protocol::SendRealOut.
 *
 * The "Rx" trace is fired when a packet is passed from the device up to the
 * ns3::Ipv4L3Protocol::Receive function.
 *
 * - In the receive function, the Ipv4InterfaceList is iterated, and if the
 *   Ipv4Interface corresponding to the receiving device is fount to be in the
 *   UP state, the trace is fired.
 *
 * The "Drop" trace is fired in any case where the packet is dropped (in both
 * the transmit and receive paths).
 *
 * - In the ns3::Ipv4Interface::Receive function, the packet is dropped and the
 *   drop trace is hit if the interface corresponding to the receiving device
 *   is in the DOWN state.
 *
 * - Also in the ns3::Ipv4Interface::Receive function, the packet is dropped and
 *   the drop trace is hit if the checksum is found to be bad.
 *
 * - In ns3::Ipv4L3Protocol::Send, an outgoing packet bound for the broadcast
 *   address is dropped and the "Drop" trace is fired if the "don't fragement"
 *   bit is set and fragmentation is available and required.
 *
 * - Also in ns3::Ipv4L3Protocol::Send, an outgoing packet destined for the 
 *   broadcast address is dropped and the "Drop" trace is hit if fragmentation
 *   is not available and is required (MTU < packet size).
 *
 * - In the case of a broadcast address, an outgoing packet is cloned for each
 *   outgoing interface.  If any of the interfaces is in the DOWN state, the 
 *   "Drop" trace event fires with a reference to the copied packet.
 *
 * - In the case of a packet requiring a route, an outgoing packet is dropped
 *   and the "Drop" trace event fires if no route to the remote host is found.
 *
 * - In ns3::Ipv4L3Protocol::SendRealOut, an outgoing packet being routed
 *   is dropped and the "Drop" trace is fired if the "don't fragement" bit is 
 *   set and fragmentation is available and required.
 *
 * - Also in ns3::Ipv4L3Protocol::SendRealOut, an outgoing packet being routed
 *   is dropped and the "Drop" trace is hit if fragmentation is not available 
 *   and is required (MTU < packet size).
 *
 * - An outgoing packet being routed is dropped and the "Drop" trace event fires
 *   if the required Ipv4Interface is in the DOWN state.
 *
 * - If a packet is being forwarded, and the TTL is exceeded (see
 *   ns3::Ipv4L3Protocol::DoForward), the packet is dropped and the "Drop" trace 
 *   event is fired.
 *
 * \subsection internetStackNs3TCPTracingModel Tracing in ns-3 TCP
 *
 * There is currently one trace source in the ns-3 TCP implementation named
 * "CongestionWindow" (see ns3::TcpSocketImpl::m_cWnd).  This is set in a number
 * of places (see file tcp-socket-impl.cc) whenever the value of the congestion
 * window is changed.
 *
 * \subsection internetStackNscTCPTracingModel Tracing in NSC TCP
 *
 * There is currently one trace source in the Network Simulation Cradle TCP 
 * implementation named "CongestionWindow" (see ns3::NscTcpSocketImpl::m_cWnd).
 * This is set in a number of places (see file nsc-tcp-socket-impl.cc) when 
 * the value of the cogestion window is initially set.  Note that this is not
 * instrumented from the underlying TCP implementaion.
 *
 * \subsection internetStackNs3UdpTracingModel Tracing in ns-3 UDP
 *
 * There is currently one trace source in the ns-3 UDP implementation named
 * "Drop" (see ns3::UdpSocketImpl::m_dropTrace).  This is set when a packet
 * is received in ns3::UdpSocketImpl::ForwardUp and the receive buffer cannot
 * accomodate the encapsulated data.
