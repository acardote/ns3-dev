/**
 * \brief Provide context to trace sources
 * \ingroup lowleveltracing
 *
 * Instances of this class are used to hold context
 * for each trace source. Each instance holds a list of
 * TraceContextElement. Trace sinks can lookup these contexts
 * from this list with the ns3::TraceContext::Get method.
 * They can also ask the TraceContext for the list of 
 * TraceContextElements it contains with the PrintAvailable method.
 *
 * This class is implemented
 * using Copy On Write which means that copying unmodified
 * versions of this class is very cheap. However, modifying
 * the content of this class through a call 
 * to ns3::TraceContext::AddElement or ns3::TraceContext::Union 
 * will trigger a costly memory reallocation if needed.
