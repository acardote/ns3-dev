@unnumbered Part II:  Validation 

The goal of the remainder of this document is to list some validation
results for the models of ns-3.  This extends beyond test code; for instance,
results that compare simulation results with actual field experiments or
with textbook results, or even with the results of other simulators,
are welcome here.   If your validation results exist in another published
report or web location, please add a reference here.
