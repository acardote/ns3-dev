ns-3 does not presently have support for statistics (automatically generated
statistical output).  This is planned
for development later in 2008.  If you are interested in contributing,
please see @uref{http://www.nsnam.org/wiki/index.php/Suggested_Projects,,our suggested projects page} or contact the ns-developers
list.
