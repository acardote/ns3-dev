Please write image files in a vector graphics format, when possible, and
generate the .png and .pdf versions on the fly (see ../Makefile).  

Recommended tools are dia, tgif, and xfig.  Store the .dia, .obj, or .fig 
versions in mercurial, but not the .png or .pdfs.  If the figure is
not available in a vector graphics format, store a .png and a .pdf version
here.

If you add a source (.dia, .obj) file here, remember to add it to
the list of figure sources in the Makefile in the directory above

Note:  tgif can convert from .obj to .pdf, but the pdf that results takes
up a whole page.  Instead, we convert to an intermediate .eps step, and
then run epstopdf.
