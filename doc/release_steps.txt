Steps in doing an ns-3 release

1. prepare the source files
   - revise and check in AUTHORS, if needed
   - revise and check in RELEASE_NOTES
   - update and check in VERSION to the latest release number
2. make a new "architecture.pdf" document and place it in the doc/ directory
3. add current version of waf script from subversion:
   - svn checkout http://waf.googlecode.com/svn/tags/ns3/ waf
   - build waf script and put it into top of ns-3-dev
4. cd ns-3-dev; ./waf configure; ./waf dist
5. test tarball on release platforms (run-tests and simple-p2p)
6. tag ns-3-dev with "release ns-3.0.X"
  - hg tag "release ns-3.0.x"
  - hg push 
7. clone the tagged ns-3-dev and place it on the repository
  - ssh code.nsnam.org; sudo; su code;
  - cp -r /home/code/repos/ns-3-dev /home/code/repos/ns-3.0.x
  - cd /home/code/repos/ns-3.0.x/.hg and edit the hgrc appropriately
8. upload "ns-3.0.x.tar.bz2" to the releases/ directory on the server
9. update web page
   - add link to news.html
   - update download.html
   - update roadmap.html
   - build and update Doxygen directory on the server
