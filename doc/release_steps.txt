Steps in doing an ns-3 release

0. check out a clean ns-3-dev somewhere
1. prepare the source files
   - revise and check in AUTHORS, if needed
   - revise and check in RELEASE_NOTES
   - update and check in VERSION to the latest release number
   - confirm that Doxygen builds cleanly and without warnings
     (./waf --doxygen), and check in any necessary changes 
2. make a new "architecture.pdf" document and place it in the doc/ directory
   of the ns-3-dev working directory
3. ./waf configure; ./waf dist
   - this will create a ns-3.0.x.tar.bz2 tarball
4. test tarball on release platforms (waf check and maybe some other scripts)
5. once you are happy with the tarball, tag ns-3-dev with "release ns-3.0.X"
   - hg tag "release ns-3.0.x"
   - hg push 
6. clone the tagged ns-3-dev and place it on the repository
   - ssh code.nsnam.org; sudo; su code;
   - cp -r /home/code/repos/ns-3-dev /home/code/repos/ns-3.0.x
   - cd /home/code/repos/ns-3.0.x/.hg and edit the hgrc appropriately
7. upload "ns-3.0.x.tar.bz2" to the /var/www/html/releases/ directory on 
   the www.nsnam.org server
8. update web page
   - add link to news.html
   - update getting_started.html
   - update documents.html
   - update roadmap on wiki
   - build and update Doxygen directory on the server
     -- ssh www.nsnam.org; sudo tcsh; su nsnam;
     -- ~/bin/update-doxygen-release
   - update and upload software architecture document (PDF, HTML)
     -- note:  HTML image generation is not currently automatic
9. announce to ns-developers, with summary of release notes
