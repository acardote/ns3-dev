		ns-3 RELEASE NOTES

This file contains ns-3 release notes (most recent releases first).

Next Release (in ns-3-dev)
==========================
- Kernel thread support (class SystemThread) added;
- Kernel mutual exclusion support (class SystemMutex) added;
- Kernel critical section RAII support (class CriticalSection) added;
- Kernel system condition support (class SystemCondition) added;
- Move required methods in helper classes to constructors;
- Change obsolete references to Parameter to Attribute in helpers;
- New NetDevice APIs: SendFrom and SetPromiscRxCallback;
- Add learning bridge (IEEE 802.1D) implementation: BridgeNetDevice;

 ---> API Changes in this release <---

In order to support the learning bridge, some API changes in Node and
NetDevice were made.

In NetDevice, devices may optionally implement the virtual methods
SendFrom, SupportsPromiscuous, and SetPromiscReceiveCallback.  If
these new methods are not implemented, the code still compiles and
works, except if they are used in a BridgeNetDevice.

In Node, the signature for protocol handler callbacks (used in
AddProtocolHandler) has changed.  Now it looks like:

  void ReceiveFromDevice (Ptr<NetDevice> device, Ptr<Packet> packet, uint16_t protocol,
                          Address const &source, Address const &destination, PacketType packetType);

The extra parameters 'destination' and 'packetType' are present for
all protocol handlers, but only have valid values for promiscuous
protocol handlers.  Protocol handlers are non-promiscuous by default,
so no action is needed to adapt existing code besides updating the
callback signature.


Release 3.1 (2008/06/30)
========================

The first ns-3 stable release
-----------------------------

This release is immediately available from:
http://www.nsnam.org/releases/ns-3.1.tar.bz2

We dedicate this initial ns-3 release to our late contributor and friend, 
Federico Maguolo.

What is ns-3 ?
--------------

ns-3 is a new discrete-event network simulator designed for supporting network
research and education. ns-3 features a solid, well documented C++ core and 
models for TCP/IP (IPv4), several link types including WiFi, and mobility 
models.

ns-3 is an open source project released under the GNU GPLv2 license which 
allows anyone to use ns-3 without having to pay any license fee or royalties. 
ns-3 is actively seeking new contributors to extend the range of supported 
models and/or to maintain existing models.

Where to get more information about ns-3
----------------------------------------

All the ns-3 documentation, is accessible from the ns-3 website: 
http://www.nsnam.org

Including, tutorials:
http://www.nsnam.org/tutorials.html

Supported platforms
-------------------

ns-3 is regularly tested on the following platforms:
  - linux x86 gcc 4.2, 4.1, and, 3.4.6.
  - linux x86_64 gcc 4.1.3, 4.2.1, 3.4.6
  - MacOS X ppc and x86
  - cygwin gcc 3.4.4 (debug only)

Known issues
------------

ns-3 is known to fail on the following platforms:
  - gcc 3.3 and earlier
  - optimized builds on gcc 3.4.4 and 3.4.5
  - optimized builds on linux x86 gcc 4.0.x

The IPv4 API defined in src/node/ipv4.h is expected to undergo major changes 
in preparation of the merge of the IPv6 API and implementation.

Future releases
---------------

Our next release, which is expected to happen in 2 to 4 months from now, will
feature the merging of some of our projects currently in development: python 
scripting, IPv6, emulation, a statistics framework and synchronous posix 
sockets.

Release 3.0.13 (2008/06/02)
===========================
- point to point links generate ppp pcap traces
- point to point links support asymmetrical data rates.
- generate doxygen documentation for all attributes and trace sources
- add ConfigStore and GtkConfigStore to contrib module
- socket API now support tx and rx buffers: implemented for UDP and TCP
- ARP cache now supports per-entry pending queues
- lots of bugfixes and implementation and API cleanups

Warning: among API changes in this release, Application::Start and 
Application::Stop now interprets the time argument as a relative
instead of absolute simulation time, to align with how Simulator::Schedule
behaves.  Any code that calls these APIs in the middle of the simulation 
will need to be adapted.  

The API of Simulator::StopAt (time) has also changed.  Now it is 
called Simulator::Stop (time), and takes a relative time, instead of 
absolute.

Release 3.0.12 (2008/04/07)
===========================
    - Add Attribute support to the TypeId metadata system and add
attribute support to all in-tree models

and perform simple ascii and pcap link-level tracing.
    - Large amount of structural changes to accomodate the needs
of the upcoming python bindings
    - new rate control algorithm (RRAA) and a jakes propagation model
in the 802.11 model (Federico Maguolo).

    - TCP delayed acknowledgements and multitasking server

Release 3.0.11 (2008/02/15)
===========================
