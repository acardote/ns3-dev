========================

The first ns-3 stable release
-----------------------------

This release is immediately available from:
http://www.nsnam.org/releases/ns-3.1.tar.bz2

We dedicate this initial ns-3 release to our late contributor and friend, 
Federico Maguolo.

What is ns-3 ?
--------------

ns-3 is a new discrete-event network simulator designed for supporting network
research and education. ns-3 features a solid, well documented C++ core and 
models for TCP/IP (IPv4), several link types including WiFi, and mobility 
models.

ns-3 is an open source project released under the GNU GPLv2 license which 
allows anyone to use ns-3 without having to pay any license fee or royalties. 
ns-3 is actively seeking new contributors to extend the range of supported 
models and/or to maintain existing models.

-------------------

ns-3 is regularly tested on the following platforms:
  - linux x86 gcc 4.2, 4.1, and, 3.4.6.
  - linux x86_64 gcc 4.1.3, 4.2.1, 3.4.6
  - MacOS X ppc and x86

  - optimized builds on gcc 3.4.4 and 3.4.5
  - optimized builds on linux x86 gcc 4.0.x

The IPv4 API defined in src/node/ipv4.h is expected to undergo major changes 
in preparation of the merge of the IPv6 API and implementation.

Future releases
---------------

Our next release, which is expected to happen in 2 to 4 months from now, will

scripting, IPv6, emulation, a statistics framework and synchronous posix 
sockets.

Release 3.0.13 (2008/06/02)
===========================
- point to point links generate ppp pcap traces
- point to point links support asymmetrical data rates.

Warning: among API changes in this release, Application::Start and 
Application::Stop now interprets the time argument as a relative
instead of absolute simulation time, to align with how Simulator::Schedule
behaves.  Any code that calls these APIs in the middle of the simulation 
will need to be adapted.  

The API of Simulator::StopAt (time) has also changed.  Now it is 
called Simulator::Stop (time), and takes a relative time, instead of 
absolute.
