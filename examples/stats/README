			  ns-3 stats example

The example script wifi-example-db.sh in this directly will run
through the entire process of running a simple experiment.  It assumes
sqlite3 is installed as it uses the sqlite3 data output format of the
statistics package.  It also assumes it is being run from the
examples/stats/ subdirectory of the ns-3 package, together with its
gnuplot script.  When the script completes successfully, a graph will
be have been produced in examples/stats/wifi-default.eps demonstrating
output from this example.

More information on the statistics package and this example is
available online on the ns-3 wiki at:
